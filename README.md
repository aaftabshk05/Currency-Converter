# Currency-Converter
This project, "Currency Converter" is a Python-based application designed to simplify currency conversion while visually representing the results. 
 The application allows users to select currencies, input an amount, and convert it based on exchange rates.
Additionally, it provides a graphical representation of the converted value, making it easier to compare the relative worth of different currencies.
The project is implemented using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Matplotlib for displaying conversion results in a bar graph.
